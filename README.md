# DANOpenInMacVim

DANOpenInMacVim is a simple Xcode Plugin that makes it easy to open the current
file in MacVim. It's based on https://github.com/Orta/OROpenInAppCode and borrows some knowledge
of Xcode internals from https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode.

## Installation

DANOpenInMacVim can be installed with [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io) or clone the repo and build the plugin.

## Usage

Hit command+control+v when selecting a file.

We use /usr/local/bin/gvim for MacVim, make sure you have /usr/local/bin/gvim linked to MacVim's script.
