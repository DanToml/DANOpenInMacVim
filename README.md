DANOpenInMacVim is a simple Xcode Plugin that makes it easy to open the current
file in MacVim. It's based on https://github.com/Orta/OROpenInAppCode and borrows some knowledge
of Xcode internals from https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode.

## Installation

DANOpenInMacVim can be installed with [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io) or clone the repo and build the plugin.
